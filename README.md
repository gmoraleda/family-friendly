# Family Friendly

Welcome! 👋

This is a personal project built to **learn and experiment** with modern web development tools and best practices. It's designed to be a practical playground for working with:

- ⚛️ **React** for building interactive user interfaces
- 🗺️ **Google Maps API** for geolocation and map integration
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** for managing structured data
- 💨 **Tailwind CSS** for fast and consistent styling
- 🌐 **Vercel** for modern deployment

The idea is to build a web app where users can discover and share family-friendly places — from restaurants to hikes and museums. It's not just a useful tool, but also a way to deepen my understanding of full-stack development.

Thanks for stopping by!
